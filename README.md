# CMS-StockManagementDemo
A system is needed to manage a dealership’s stock-on-hand. The system will be used as the primary source of all vehicles being advertised on online platforms such as AutoTrader, Cars.co.za, Carfind.co.za. The system’s database will also be the primary source from which stock will be quoted from (by means of another system).
